# COSC 315: Assignment 3

In this assignment, you will work towards creating a producer-consumer application using synchronization concepts discussed in class.

Before getting started, please ensure you have a working starter environment with Docker using the COSC 315 starter code available [here](https://github.com/brikwerk/cosc315-starter). If you have not set this up yet, please follow the instructions available in the starter code repository before working on this assignment.

Additionally, please also ensure you have a working Java development environment (e.g.
Eclipse, IntelliJ, command line, etc). If you do not have a development environment setup,
please reach out to your TA or instructor. This assignment assumes you have used Java for
development before.

## Getting Started

This assignment is more free-form than previous assignments. How you design and code the two parts described below is generally up to you. However, please refrain from building something complex that your TA will be unable to compile and reproduce. If there are assumptions made when building or compiling your code, please include a README file explaining any needed instructions.

For Java development, you are free to use your own development environment.

For C development, you are required to continue developing inside the Docker container.
